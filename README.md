# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This is an exercise to start experimenting with sprites in Python Arcade. This repository assumes that you have Python Arcade installed.

The exercise takes place across three files:

 * main1.py:
   added random animals across the plane in random coordinates for each animal.
 * main2.py:
   placed two animals in the plane with their speech bubbles directly above each animal that change.
 * main3.py:
   changed code to the best of my availability to allow for the moose icon to follow the mouse movement, but I can't get it to work and I'm not sure why. 
 * main4.pyâ€”*extra credit*:
  Did not complete. This file contains the opportunity to make a college of sprites from outside programs and lists. 

As usual, fork and clone this repository. Edit the LICENSE and README.md, and submit the URL of your repository to Canvas.
